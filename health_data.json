The girl was born in Guatemala, and soon after her birth, her parents moved to the United States so that they could access better healthcare. During pregnancy, the mother had little prenatal care, but labor and delivery were uneventful. However, the newborn had significant abdominal distention immediately at birth that increased when she ate or yawned. She failed to pass stool in the first 24 hours of life and had greenish-black vomitus. The parents report similar symptoms in other family members. After diagnosis, the girl underwent a procedure that alleviated her symptoms; however, there was no remission. Her abdominal X-ray (see the first image) and barium contrast enema (second image) from when she was born is shown. Her blood pressure is 100\/68 mm Hg, heart rate is 96\/min, respiratory rate is 19\/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). The girl is in the 10th percentile for height and weight.

The study started in 2018 by including incident pre-dialysis patients (with chronic kidney disease in stage IV or V) who were already included in pre-dialysis care procedures between 2014 and 2016. These patients were subsequently found in the records of the hospitals participating in the study, and patient files were used to note the laboratory measurements at baseline. The medical courses of those patients were then followed through the medical charts (most notably their decline in renal function) until the start of dialysis, their death, or January 1, 2018. From this data, the researchers calculated that faster declines in renal function were linked to higher phosphate levels at baseline. Moreover, a relative risk for dying (1.5-fold) could be calculated for every mg\/dL increase in phosphate levels. Hence, a high plasma phosphate level was shown to be an independent risk factor for not only a more rapid decline in renal function but also for higher mortality rates during the pre-dialysis phase.
